Hi, I don't think anyone knows me yet but trust me you won't even know me after. I'm a simple guy, a citizen what do you want me to become famous, pffh don't even make me think about it. Anyway I introduce myself my name is Mattia (Italian name) and I come from Florence a small corner of the world where to do absolutely nothing, leaving that aside let's go on with my presentation, biography, description in short something that concerns me OK! Excuse me as I am addressing you on a collaboration and sharing platform for computer jobs but as I have described myself well I don't think it needs anything else to say, Or at least for now. it's all my friends.
Ok, ok now I'm serious, after browsing for hours on github I found out what a READ ME is needed: it is needed to start a project like the one I want to undertake. new user, do not immediately target those who still do not know how github works like me, be peaceful and help.
